# Explore U.S Births
Practice the basics of Python by analyzing births in the U.S.
1) Converting Data Into A List Of Lists - While a list of strings helps us get a general picture of the dataset, we need to convert it to a more structured format to be able to analyze it. Specifically, we need to convert the dataset into a list of lists where each nested list contains integer values (not strings).
2) Calculating Number Of Births Each Month - Create a dictionary where each key is a unique month and each value is the number of births that happened in that month, across all years.
3) Calculating Number Of Births Each Day Of Week - Create a function that calculates the total number of births for each unique day of the week.
4) Creating A More General Function - Create a single function that works for any column and specify the column we want as a parameter each time we call the function.
